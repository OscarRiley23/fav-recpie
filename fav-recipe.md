>Mac and cheese is the ultimate comfort food. This version contains all the components of a jalapeno popper- bacon, cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and of course, lots of jalapenos. It’s wonderfully salty and cheesy with a spicy kick.

**\*You want to cook your pasta just until al dente. It will cook a little more in the oven\!**

I use a combination of cheddar cheese and mozzarella which I think is perfect for complementing the cream cheese. You could use Monterey Jack instead of the mozzarella cheese or Pepper Jack if you want to add more heat.

*If you want less heat, remove the ribs and seeds from the jalapenos.*


## Ingredients

* 4  tablespoons  butter
* 1/2  medium  sweet onion,  diced
*  2 to 3  jalapeno peppers,  finely chopped
* 1/4  cup  all-purpose flour
* 1 3/4  cups  milk
* 1 1/2  cups  heavy cream
* 6  ounces  cream cheese,  softened
* 2  cups  shredded mozzarella cheese
* 2  cups  shredded sharp cheddar cheese
* 1  teaspoon  salt
* 1/2  teaspoon  pepper
* 8  slices  bacon,  cooked and crumbled
* 1/2  cup  Panko crumbs
* 2  tablespoons  melted butter
* 1  pound  pasta (elbow, penne, cavatappi),  cooked according to package directions

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Melt butter over medium heat in a Dutch oven. Add onion and jalapeno and cook 3 minutes to soften.
3. Add flour and cook and stir for 1 minute.
4. Gradually whisk in milk and heavy cream. Bring to a simmer and simmer several minutes to thicken.
5. Cut cream cheese in to chunks so it will melt faster and add to Dutch oven. Stir until melted.
6. Add mozzarella and stir until melted.
7. Add cheddar, remove from heat, and stir until melted.
8. Stir in salt and pepper.
9. Add pasta and bacon and mix in well. You can reserve some bacon to sprinkle on top if you wish. Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish.
10. Combine Panko crumbs and melted butter and sprinkle on top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
